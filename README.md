Titanic survival prediction using machine learning is a popular task in the field of data science. The goal is to develop a model that can predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and embarked port.
Steps follows:
1. Import the required libraries.
2. Access a pandas DataFrame and load the dataset.
3. Preprocess the data by rectifying missing values, encoding features, and selecting features.
4. Divide the data into two sets: training and testing.
5. Develop and train a machine learning model.
Make predictions based on the test set.
7. Evaluate the accuracy of the model.
